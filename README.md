# PythagoreanTheorem

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purpose of this assignment was to use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate he hypotenuse of a traingle given the lengths of the other sides as user inputs.

In this simple implementation, the values of a and b can be inputted through UITextFields and the results are updated live. The triangle in question is drawn below the inputs, scaled to to the available space.
